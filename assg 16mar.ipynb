    " overfitting can lead to misleadingly high accuracy on the training data, but it tends to reduce the accuracy on new, unseen data. This happens because the model has learned the noise and specific patterns of the training data so well that it struggles to generalize to new, unseen data, resulting in a decrease in accuracy. \n",
    " \n",
    "To mitigate overfitting, several techniques can be used, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Cross-validation to assess the model's performance on unseen data.\n",
    "2) Regularization methods such as L1 or L2 regularization to reduce the complexity of the model.\n",
    "3) Feature selection to eliminate irrelevant and redundant features.\n",
    "4) Using more training data to provide a more representative sample for the model to learn from.\n",
    "\n",
    "Underfitting is associated with low accuracy on both the training and test data. The model's inability to capture the underlying patterns and complexity of the data leads to poor predictive performance. Mitigating underfitting involves several approaches, such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Increasing Model Complexity: Using more complex models that can capture the underlying patterns in the data.\n",
    "2) Adding More Features: Incorporating additional relevant features to provide the model with more information to learn from.\n",
    "3) Using More Advanced Algorithms: Employing algorithms with higher capacity and flexibility to capture complex relationships in the data.\n",
    "4) Gathering More Data: Increasing the size and diversity of the training dataset to provide a more representative sample."
