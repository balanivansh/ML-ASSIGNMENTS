    "Ridge regression is a model tuning method that is used to analyse any data that suffers from multicollinearity. This method performs L2 regularization. When the issue of multicollinearity occurs, least-squares are unbiased, and variances are large, this results in predicted values being far away from the actual values.\n",

    "In ordinary least square regression there is a difference in variance between predictor variables, OLS tends to give higher variance for coefficients corresponding to predictors with higher variance, while Ridge Regression reduces the variance differences between coefficients by shrinking them towards zero."

    "Ridge regression is popular because it uses regularization for making predictions and regularization is intended to resolve the problem of overfitting. We mainly find that overfitting is where the size of data is very large and ridge regression works by penalizing the coefficient of features and it also minimizes the errors in prediction. "
